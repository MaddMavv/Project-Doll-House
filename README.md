# Project-Doll-House
This is the source code for Project Doll House.

This project uses the Godot Engine and relies on the built-in scripting language GDScript to function. C#, C++, and other languages are supported but are only to be implemented for performance boosts, engine modification, and use of 3rd party libraries.
